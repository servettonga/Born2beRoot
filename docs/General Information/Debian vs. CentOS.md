# Debian vs. CentOS

## Similarities between Debian and CentOS

- Debian, as well as CentOS, are both based on the Linux kernel. Both these versions of Linux support ARM64 architecture.
- Both cover all the basic functions and features of an OS like Process Management, Memory and Disk management, Input/Output Operations, Device Management, and Execution Processing.
- Both are free.
- Both have community support.
- Both are stable and get updated on a timely basis.

### Differences

Debian supports MIPSel, MIPS64el, and s390x architectures, while CentOS does not. On the other hand, CentOS 7 supports POWER9 and armhf/armhfp while Debian does not. Overall speaking, CentOS does not support as many architectures as Debian does.

CentOS has a larger community providing support and hence more stable than Debian due to the added support provided by Red Hat Limited.

For Package management, RPM as package format and YUM/DNF as the package manager are supported by CentOS, whereas Debian has the DEB as package format and dpkg/APT as the package manager.

Both Debian and CentOS support various Filesystems, but by default, CentOS comes with XFS, whereas Debian has EXT4. However, it is important to point out that some filesystems are only supported by Debian, not CentOS, for example, ZFS.

Both Debian and CentOS get upgraded to newer versions regularly, but the difference is in their lifecycle. CentOS does not support regular major updates, but some minor tweaks and bug fixes may occur from time to time. CentOS versions last for about a decade, and switching to the newer version is not smooth. In contrast, Debian does support regular version updates every 2 to 3 years, and the transition process for Debian is also very smooth and mostly error-free.

In terms of support, both Debian and CentOS and supported by the community since they are both based on the open-source Linux kernel. However, CentOS users can submit crash and error reports to Red Hat to amend them in a minor upstream release.
