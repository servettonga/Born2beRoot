# Secure Shell (SSH)

## What is SSH?

SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.

SSH also refers to the suite of utilities that implement the SSH protocol. Secure Shell provides strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an open network, such as the internet.

In addition to providing strong encryption, SSH is widely used by network administrators to manage systems and applications remotely, enabling them to log in to another computer over a network, execute commands and move files from one computer to another.

SSH refers both to the cryptographic network protocol and to the suite of utilities that implement that protocol. SSH uses the client-server model, connecting a Secure Shell client application, which is the end where the session is displayed, with an SSH server, which is the end where the session runs. SSH implementations often include support for application protocols used for terminal emulation or file transfers.

SSH can also be used to create secure tunnels for other application protocols, for example, to securely run X Window System graphical sessions remotely. An SSH server, by default, listens on the standard Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 22.

## How does SSH work?

Secure Shell was created to replace insecure terminal emulation or login programs, such as Telnet, rlogin (remote login) and rsh (remote shell). SSH enables the same functionsâ€“logging in to and running terminal sessions on remote systems. SSH also replaces file transfer programs, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and rcp (remote copy).

The most basic use of SSH is to connect to a remote host for a terminal session. The form of that command is the following:

```shell
ssh UserName@SSHserver.example.com
```

This command will cause the client to attempt to connect to the server named *server.example.com*, using the user ID *UserName*. If this is the first time negotiating a connection between the local host and the server, the user will be prompted with the remote host's public key fingerprint and prompted to connect, despite there having been no prior connection:

```shell
The authenticity of host 'sample.ssh.com' cannot be established.

DSA key fingerprint is 01:23:45:67:89:ab:cd:ef:ff:fe:dc:ba:98:76:54:32:10.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

Answering *yes* to the prompt will cause the session to continue, and the host key is stored in the local system's known_hosts file. This is a hidden file, stored by default in a hidden directory, called `/.ssh/known_hosts`, in the user's home directory. Once the host key has been stored in the known_hosts file, the client system can connect directly to that server again without need for any approvals; the host key authenticates the connection.

## What is SSH used for?

Present in all data centers, SSH ships by default with every Unix, Linux and Mac server. SSH connections have been used to secure many different types of communications between a local machine and a remote host, including secure remote access to resources, remote execution of commands, delivery of software patches, and updates and other administrative or management tasks.

In addition to creating a secure channel between local and remote computers, SSH is used to manage routers, server hardware, virtualization platforms, operating systems (OSes), and inside systems management and file transfer applications.

Secure Shell is used to connect to servers, make changes, perform uploads and exit, either using tools or directly through the terminal. SSH keys can be employed to automate access to servers and often are used in scripts, backup systems and configuration management tools.
