This is an exercise related to **System Administration**, which involves the use of **Debian 12** and **VirtualBox** on a macOS system. The aim of this exercise is to gain a deeper understanding of system administration tasks and to enhance skills in managing and configuring virtual environments.

Please note that configuration scripts and notes may vary depending on individual setups. This is due to the unique characteristics of each system, including the specific versions of software installed, the systemâ€™s hardware configuration, and the personal preferences of the user.

You might consider using Vagrant, Packer and Ansible for unattended installation and configuration if you have more time and patience to learn.
